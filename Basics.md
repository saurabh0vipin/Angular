## Components in Angular  
	* Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. An Angular Application is a tree of components.  
	* Eg. Menu components, Signup/Login Components etc  
### Creating A component  
	** ng generate eomponent <component_Name>**  
	* We can reuse these components as many as times we want  
	* These sub components should be written in app.components beacuse app component is a root component.
