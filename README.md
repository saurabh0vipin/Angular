# Angular
  * Angular is a TypeScript based, open source, frontend web application development framework.  
  * Angular uses TypeScript as programming language which is a superset of JavaScript.   
  * Since most of the web browsers are unable to understand TypeScript hence is gets translated in the JS code.
